# ðŸ“š SDG 4 â€“ Adaptive Learning Tutor

An AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to provide personalized practice for students, aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education).
The system dynamically adjusts questions based on learner mastery using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), ensuring a tailored learning experience.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ” Adaptive Question Selection based on learner's mastery
âœ” Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) for tracking concept mastery
âœ” Concept-wise Mastery Visualization with progress bars and charts
âœ” Dynamic Recommendations for low-mastery concepts with resource links
âœ” Session History to review performance
âœ” Built with Streamlit for an interactive and responsive UI

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

Streamlit (UI Framework)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib / Streamlit Charts (Mastery Visualization)

ðŸ“Š How It Works

Mastery Initialization: Each concept starts with a mastery probability of 0.2.

Question Selection: The system selects the next question from the concept with the lowest mastery.

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) updates mastery after every response.

Recommendations: If mastery < 0.6, the app suggests concepts and resources to review.
